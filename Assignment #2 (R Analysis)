## Introduction 
The table used in this analysis derives from a SQL Database that was used to record the attitudes of 5 survey respondents on the top 6 movies in 2022.
Along with the collection of attitudes, the demographic variables of each participant was also recorded to draw any conclusion of how the selected movies were perceived may relate to demographic factors.
The movies included in the dataset are...
  1. Top Gun Maverick
  2. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
  3. Avatar: The Way of Water
  4. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
  5. Jurassic World Domination
  6. Minions: The Rise of Guru

The likert scale used for the survey were all formatted positively so the overall scale is from 1-5, 1 being the most negative towards the topic of a question, and 5 having the most positive attitude towards said question.

## Missing values
the missing values in this table represents those who did not watch the designated movie and therefore cannot express any attitudes towards them. The msising data will be replaced by the number 0, not to represent their attitudes on the 1-5 likert scale but to represent their absence of attitudes.

## Conclusion
The data imported cleaned and manipulated in this process sets a workable dataset to conduct data analysis. Potential questions to investigate is the possible relationship between the demographic variables and the collected attitudes towards the films such as work status and and amount of movies watched and education status and the overall attitude towards each movie. 
This dataset has the potential to report accurate and generalizable insights if more resposes were collected, more demographic variables were asked (such as gender), and the statistics and qualities of each film (such as EOY gross, tickets sold, genre, distributor, etc)
