## Intro
Using the information you collected on movie ratings, implement a Global Baseline Estimate recommendation system in R.  
Most recommender systems use personalized algorithms like “content management” and “item-item collaborative filtering.” Sometimes non-personalized recommenders are also useful or necessary. One of the best non-personalized recommender system algorithms is the “Global Baseline Estimate.
The job here is to use the survey data collected and write the R code that makes a movie recommendation using the Global Baseline Estimate algorithm.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for implementation details.
